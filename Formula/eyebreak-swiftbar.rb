# Homebrew formula for eyebreak-swiftbar.
#
# This repo doubles as its own tap, so once a release exists users can run:
#
#     brew tap mirxomitov/tap
#     brew install eyebreak-swiftbar
#
# ...or install the tip of main right now with:
#
#     brew install --HEAD mirxomitov/tap/eyebreak-swiftbar
#
# Homebrew must not write outside its prefix during `install`, so this formula
# only stages the files and compiles the blocker into libexec. The actual copy
# into ~/.eyebreak and the SwiftBar plugin folder happens when the user runs the
# `eyebreak-swiftbar` command it installs — see the caveats.

    <<~EOS
      This plugin needs SwiftBar. If you don't have it yet:

        brew install --cask swiftbar

      Then launch SwiftBar once (so it creates ~/SwiftBar/Plugins) and deploy the
      plugin into your home dir and that folder:

        eyebreak-swiftbar

      Finally, open SwiftBar (or "Refresh All") and grant notification permission.

      If your SwiftBar plugin folder isn't ~/SwiftBar/Plugins:

        SWIFTBAR_PLUGIN_DIR="$HOME/path/to/plugins" eyebreak-swiftbar
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_predicate libexec/"eyebreak-blocker", :executable?
    assert_path_exists libexec/"plugin/eyebreak.1s.sh"
  end
end
